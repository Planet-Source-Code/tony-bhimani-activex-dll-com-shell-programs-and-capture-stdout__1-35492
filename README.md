## ActiveX DLL \(COM\) \- Shell Programs and Capture Stdout


</div>

### Description

This project is very similar to AspExec. It is a DLL that can be used through ASP, ColdFusion, or an EXE. It creates a process and captures the stdout and/or stderr output from that process. This does not use the > redirection to send data to a temp file.

The project includes the source for the COM DLL and examples of using it in a VB program, ASP, and ColdFusion.

Please read the Readme.txt file in the zip for full documentation.
 
### More Info
 
Required: Application path and/or name to shell.

Optional: Parameter string to pass to the shelled application and window state (0=hide 1=show)

stdout and/or stderr from the created process. This is stored in a VB string and returned to the calling procedure.

None that I know of.
